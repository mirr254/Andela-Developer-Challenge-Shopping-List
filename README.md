![travis build pass](https://travis-ci.org/mirr254/Andela-Developer-Challenge-Shopping-List.svg?branch=master)

The Andela Developer Challenge is founded on the premise that aspiring Technology Leaders learn programming whilst building things that matter. That the best way to learn code is by building a complete product. As we build applications that solve real problems, we internalize deeply the skills needed to be World Class Software Developers.

Challenge:

The challenge of -----keeping track of shopping items---- is a need for -----many individuals----- that requires an innovative and robust solution that will ----- allow them to remember and share the shopping lists with others -----.

Description of the application:

The innovative -----shopping list app----- is a web based application that  -----allows users  to record and share things they want to spend money on ----- meeting the needs of -----keeping track of their shopping lists -----.

First thing done was to create a project for the Whole Shopping List challenge on the pivotal tracker web.
